            <h3>New Horizons color images reveal two distinct faces of Pluto</h3>
            <p>NASA's New Horizon spacecraft has captured stunning coloured images of Pluto as it gets ready for a close flyby of the mysterious planet system on July 14.The images show two very different faces of the mysterious dwarf planet, one with a series of intriguing spots along the equator that are evenly-spaced.</p>
<p>Each of the spots is about 480 km in diameter, with a surface area that is roughly the size of the state of Missouri, the US space agency said in a statement.Scientists have yet to see anything quite like the dark spots."It's a real puzzle -- we don't know what the spots are and we cannot wait to find out," said New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern.</p>
<p>If Pluto has clouds, New Horizon can detect them.For more than two decades, planetary scientists have raced to get a spacecraft to Pluto against predictions that its atmosphere would disappear -- literally freezing onto the surface -- before it could be explored."Pluto's atmosphere is alive and well, and has not frozen out on the surface," noted New Horizons deputy project scientist Leslie Young.</p>
