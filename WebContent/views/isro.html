            <h3>ISRO Plans To Have Humans Working From ‘Igloos’ On The Moon!</h3>
            <p>Making an effort to extend space research, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), has started working on building igloo-like habitats on the lunar surface for potential future missions, according to a report by The Times of India.</p>
<p>The moon is a crucial and close destination for research and planetary exploration not just for ISRO but many of the world’s national and international space agencies (such as NASA, ESA, and others). Lunar missions are the first steps in expanding the manned and unmanned exploration of our solar system.</p>
<p>The moon can be used as a laboratory with lower gravity (1/6 of the earth’s gravity field) as it is the closest and most accessible planetary object from Earth.
With that in mind, the space research organisation has planned to build ‘lunar habitats,’ which will serve as an “outpost” by sending robots and 3D printers to the Moon. It will be built by using the soil there, as well as other materials.</p>
